          Here we see Alexa Demie and Jacob Elordi as Maddy and Nate played in the
          show Euphoria. Then pictured is Sydney Sweeney who plays Cassie a sweet
          girl and people pleaser especially when it comes to men. She undergos
          a totaly beauty regiment starting at 4 AM in hopes of catching the eye
          of Nate. This is just one piece of media that shows the insecurities
          women have based on the male gaze. To feel worthy is to be seen by and
          recognized by men.

        Here we see Jameela Jamil as Tahani Al-Jamil in the sitcom The Good Place.
        Throughout the show she reprsents how women, at times, make decisions based
        off of what she thinks the world wants. Beauty is defined by the rest of
        the world and decisions are never made based off of what the woman wants.

        Here we see Saoirse Ronan as Christine "Lady Bird" in Lady Bird. She is
        an outspoken character who comes to terms with her newly found feminity.
        This sense of realization correlates with the words of the women in A
        New Way Of Seeing.
