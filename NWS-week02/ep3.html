        Here we see North West with her white Hermes Birkin bag. The bag pictures
        costs a repoted $10,000. These bags were becoming the modern depiction
        of what oil paintings have been and continue to be.

        Here we see a Louis Vuitton workshop where craftsmen and women have been
        handmaking the bags since the 1900s. Just as paintings have been worked
        on with such time and care for the most elegant result.

        Here we see Ariana Granda at The Met Gala 2018, her dress inspired by a
        Michelangelo painting. This exhibits a beautiful attempt to recreate an
        existing moment, while the moment is preserved it can't be fully repeated
        as Berger says.
