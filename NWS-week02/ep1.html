     Here we see Margot Robbie playing Sharon Tate in Quentin Tarantino's Once
     Upon a time in Hollywood. As she's dancing we get a glimpse of L'automne
     by Alfons Mucha. While one may not have noticed upon first glance, here is a
     great example of how art has no boundaries. It is easily trasmittable in todays
     day and age, art pieces are being flown all around the world for people to see and admire.

     Here we see Beyonce and Jay-Z for their video Apeshit. Throughout the music video,
     they display art work around the Lourve in the intentions of displaying the
     significance of culture and society alongside sound and image. Using these art
     pieces in this way produces an increased awarness around being Black in the
     traditional art space, that would not have been so visibly featured otherwise.

     Here we see the robbers from La Casa de Papel (Money Heist) wearing red overalls
     and Salvador Dali masks. Dali's face serves as a physical symbol of the show's
     theme, the resistance towards the system, as the robbers wear his face they are
     rebelling against societal norms just as Dali once did. There is a handful of
     motifs between the two, and by using Dali as the face of their resistance we
     can see the intentions of Dali's paintings. There is a clear correlation
     between his paintings and his political thoughts. As most Spanish artists
     rejected modern capitalist society.
