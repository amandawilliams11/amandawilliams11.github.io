    In contrast to "As We May Think" I like this opposite approach to technology.
    It started off explaining how we take tech for granted, and if we as consumers
    keep using the web in the wrong way something bad in the future is going to
    happen. We need to set boundaries especially within the government. Nothing
    that we put out into the internet is actually ours. We are constantly being
    watched and data is always being collected. Some companies even sell our data
    for personal profit, which isn't what tech was supposed to be for in the first
    place. I'd like to think that we're not too far gone in the maze of the
    internet, but at the same time what can be done now to reverse the effects of
    what we had already done in terms of privacy.
