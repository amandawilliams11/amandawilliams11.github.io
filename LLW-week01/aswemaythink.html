    The Internet, such a big network to get a grasp on. So we start at the beginning,
     while reading Vannenar Bush's "As We May Think" I learned that just like how humans
     have memory and can categorize information so can technology. Bush applied this
     way of thinking to science. Throughout his piece, he reiterates the fact that
     technology is constantly changing and imporving for the better. This makes me
     think about all the possibilities of the future in tech. It makes me think about
     flying cars, holographic tech, smart everything! Althoughit all seems very intriguing
     and high tech I also worry about the consequences of having such an advanced world.
     In Bush's text he reminds us that there's always going to be a newer way to do things,
     but we can't forget about the original ways that work just as good with some motification.
