      <h1>Quote</h1>
      <p>"The older, traditional ideas of private, isolated thoughts and actions— the patterns of mechanistic technologies—are very seriously threatened by
        new methods of instantaneous electric information retrieval, by the electrically computerized dossier bank—that one big gossip column that is unforgiving,
        unforgetful and from which there is no redemption, no erasure of early "mistakes." We have already reached a point where remedial control, born out
        of knowledge of media and their total effects on all of us, must be exerted. How shall the new environment be programmed now that we have become so
        involved with each other, now that all of us have become the unwitting work force for social change? What's that buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzing?""</p>
      <h1>My thoughts</h1>
      <p>This reading really opened my eyes to the affects of technology on my generation, past generations, and the future generations. The media has made it
        easy for users to share practically everything they please. We all can know so much about eachother with a click of a button. The sense of privacy or
        curiosity is out of the window, everything is all just out there in the open for the world to see. This makes me think of cancel culture in terms of old
        social media posts of celebrities or influencers. Specifically during 2020 when BLM was getting more attention a lot of secrets were uncovered. Old tweets
        for the most part, of these people we all look up to, saying racist comments or blantantly saying the n word in old videos. Even though such tweets can
        be deleted, people still have screenshots and such things to remind these influencers that once you put something on the internet it has the capability of
        following you forever. I think it's so important to realize the power media has on our lives. Sometimes it's easy to forget about all the power it holds
        because at this point it has been integrated into our daily lives. This book was a great reminder that technology is not going away and is here to stay
        no matter what the affects of it is. (Click on image below)
