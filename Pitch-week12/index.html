          <h1>Let's Talk About it</h1>
          <p>Let's Talk About it is a website that will offer a truly comprehensive and inclusive mental health education American public schools often fail to
            provide. This website will offer information on topics including DBT key concepts like validation, extreme emotions, acceptancr, positivity,
            coping mechanisms, problem solving, and mindfulness. This is meant to be another additioinal resource that teens and young adults can use to find
            accurate, current, and intersectional information on mental health. </p>

          <h1>Context</h1>
          <p>Let's Talk About it website will be the first of many platforms that includes menteal health resources created by me. I am passionate about
            intersectional representation in all fields, and upon noticing the huge discrepincies in the way that Mental Health is taught in our public
            schools, I wanted to do something about it. I really want to help others like how Dialectical Behaviour Therapy helped me, so what better way to do
            that than make a website.

          <h1>Design Strategy</h1>
          <p>To design this website I want to further extends the brands existing identity by staying inline with their color scheme and general vibe. I want
            the website to feel sleek and easy to read, as educational sited can often come across as really overwhelming. The fonts, spacing, and other
            components are going to be essencial in creating an online space that lends itself to teaching and connecting with a young audience. </p>

        <div id = "fiveB" class = "content">
          <h1>Functions</h1>
          <p>I imagine I will mostly use functions to display information in interesting ways, much like I have on this page. I'm going to take full advantage
            of using JQuery to hid and show different elements of a page when relevant. I think it will also be useful to implement functions for annimations
            on the page to really bring a piece that could otherwise be static and full of text to life. </p>

          <h1>Research Plan</h1>
          <p>I plan to do a lot of outside research in order to make sure that the site is as accurate as possible. Luckily I have collected information from
            my DBT worksheets to bounce of off, which has plenty of resources and places I can look to for information. </p>
